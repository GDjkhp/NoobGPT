**Let me be with you! (>3<)**
* I can generate AI text and images!
* I can play music in voice channels!
* I can lookup TV shows, movies, anime and manga!
* I can download and convert YouTube videos!

**You can customize me as your own! How cool is that!**
* Set me up as a very helpful, precise and concise AI assistant chatbot, or not! I can help you cheat your homework, code the next ChatGPT, or even cook meth! I will insult you if you don't set me up this way >:(
* Set up Character.AI characters! You can add up to 15 characters per channels/threads/forums. Either chat with them (if you need someone to talk to), or let them talk to each other (O_O)
* Set up only nessesary commands you want! You don't want members learn how to cook meth. I'm fully modular when you think about it ;)
* Set up DJ role for music! You don't want members spam "Thick of It" in the music VC.
* Set up bot master role for your moderator homies! Let them handle me when shit happens.
* Want further customizations? It's open source!

> Hosting your own instance is recommended. 24/7 uptime is not guaranteed :(
